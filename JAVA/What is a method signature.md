### [method signature](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29672548/what-is-a-method-signature)

A _method signature_ is the part of the method based on which you _overload / override_ it. It contains:

1. The method name.
2. The arguments passed to it.

It doesn't contain:
1. Scope / access modifier.
2. Return type.
