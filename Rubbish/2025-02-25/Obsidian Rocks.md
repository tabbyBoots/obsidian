- ## [Keeping Your Obsidian Plugins Up-to-Date](https://obsidian.rocks/keeping-your-obsidian-plugins-up-to-date/)

Quick tip this morning: I’m a big fan of community plugins. They are a big reason why Obsidian is the powerhouse that it is. From Dataview to Linter, Obsidian wouldn’t be the same without the community that surrounds it. But if you’re like me, you often forget to keep your Obsidian plugins up-to-date. Updating your…

I love Daily Notes in Obsidian. I’ve written before about the dynamic blocks I use in Daily Notes, but I don’t think I’ve ever talked about my latest version of my Daily Note template. So let’s talk about it! My Journal system is highly modular. Not only do I write daily journal entries, but I…

![Power Features of Tasks in Obsidian](https://i0.wp.com/obsidian.rocks/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pretty-tasks-banner.png?fit=600%2C290&ssl=1)

I love the tasks plugin. And I’ve written several articles about it: from a basic task system to a much more comprehensive one. Many people have asked why I manage tasks in Obsidian. “It’s a note taking app” they say. Why bother reinventing the wheel? I’ve talked about it many times before, but it all…

Slow startup time has plagued me for ages on Obsidian Mobile. I first wrote about it many months ago, and I had a bunch of tips to help deal with slow startup time. And those tips still work, but there’s an upcoming update for Obsidian mobile that is going to make this much easier and…

It’s no secret that I love callouts in Obsidian. Whenever a note starts to feel overwhelming, I try to do two things: break the note into multiple atomic notes, and pretty the note up with headings and callouts. But I have a problem with callouts: the format is hard to remember. Nearly every time I…

Many years ago, when I was a bachelor with more time than sense, I decided to become a pilot. I spent $10,000 and several years pursuing this. And I succeeded, eventually earning a private pilot’s license and the ability to fly my own (rented) prop plane. But there was one day when I questioned it…

I love themes in Obsidian. I love how varied there are, how many of them there are, and how much customization they allow. But I only recently discovered that one theme, the Border theme, has greater customization than I ever could have imagined. Why do I love customization? Because themes allow you to fine-tune Obsidian…
- ## [Quick Tip: Obsidian and Stacked Tabs](https://obsidian.rocks/quick-tip-obsidian-and-stacked-tabs/)

I forgot that Stacked Tabs existed in Obsidian! Back in the day, stacked tabs required a plugin. In the community it was called Andy Matuschak Mode, affectionally based on Andy Matuschak’s killer notes. But the Obsidian devs liked Matuschak Mode so much that they Sherlocked it, and built it into the core app. No need…

I often hear people complain that Obsidian sync isn’t built-in. “Evernote has it. Apple Notes has it. OneNote has it. Why isn’t sync handled automatically in Obsidian?” It’s a good question, and the answer requires some nuance. Obsidian is different than most other apps, because the company that built it cares about your file sovereignty.…

I’m a big believer in simple systems. Every system should be as simple as possible, but no simpler. One of the reasons I love Obsidian is that it’s easy to build simple systems, using nothing more than links and text. But if you’re new to Obsidian, you might not know how. How do we build…
