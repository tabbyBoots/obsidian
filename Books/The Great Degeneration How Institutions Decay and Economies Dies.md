		- small and centralized government
		- social relationships organized along personal and dynastic lines
	- 2nd open access pattern

- [[Acemoglu]] and [[Robinson]] illustrate the power of institutions relative to geography and culture by describing the city of Nogales, which is bisected by the US–Mexican border.
- Development economists – notably [[Paul Collier]]  – have been thinking in these terms for some time.
- [[Extractive institutions]], as described by [[Daron Acemoglu]] , are economic
  and political arrangements that concentrate power and resources in the 
  hands of a small elite or ruling class, often at the expense of the 
  broader population.
- [[Hernando de Soto]]'s experiment
	- By slogging away in the shanty towns of Lima, Port-au-Prince, Cairo and Manila, he and his researchers established that, though their incomes are low, the poor of the world have a surprisingly large amount of property.
	- As an experiment, de Soto and his team tried to establish a small garment workshop on the outskirts of Lima on a legal basis. It took them a staggering 289 days to do so. And when they tried to secure legal authorization to build a house on state-owned land, it took even longer: six years and eleven months, during which they had to deal with fifty-two different government offices.
	- Dysfunctional institutions like these, de Soto argues, are what force the poor to live outside the law.

	- General government net debt as a percentage of revenue
- the economist [[Laurence Kotlikoff]] calculates that to eliminate the federal government’s fiscal gap would require an immediate 64 per cent increase in all federal taxes or an immediate 40 per cent cut in all federal expenditures.
- [[social contract]]-partnership between the generations
- In his  [[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]  (1790), [[Edmund Burke]] wrote that the real social contract is not [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] ’s contract between the sovereign and the people or ‘general will’, but the ‘partnership’ between the generations.
